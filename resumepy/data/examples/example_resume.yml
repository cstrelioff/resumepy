work:
  - organization: University of California at Davis
    start: Nov 2013
    stop: Mar 2014
    position: Programmer IV
    location: Davis, CA
    notes:
      - Developed inference pipeline to calculate Bayesian posterior probabilities for millions of candidate unifilar Hidden Markov Models (uHMMs). The multi-threaded Python implementation allowed for more efficient use of multi-cpu nodes on a Linux cluster running Slurm.
  - organization: University of California at Davis
    start: 2012
    stop: 2013
    position: Postdoc
    location: Davis, CA
    notes:
      - Derived analytic results for Bayesian inference of uHMMs from data. Implemented these methods, including parameter inference and model comparison for different uHMM topologies, in the CMPy Python package.
  - organization: University of California at Los Angeles
    start: 2010
    stop: 2012
    position: Postdoc
    location: Los Angeles, CA
    notes:
      - Created a Bayesian state-space model to analyze influenza data from pigs, including inference of missing observations.
      - Inferred parameters of model using Python and PyMC on a Linux cluster running Sun (Oracle) Grid Engine.
  - organization: Michigan State University
    start: 2007
    stop: 2010
    position: Postdoc
    location: East Lansing, MI
    notes:
      - Implemented stochastic model in C++ to infer mutation rates and fitness effect of mutations from experimental data.
      - Developed Python code to create and analyze social networks from observations of a Hyena population in Kenya.
